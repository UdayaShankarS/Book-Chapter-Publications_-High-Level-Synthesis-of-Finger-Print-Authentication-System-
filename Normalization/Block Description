            The normalization adapts the variations of gray level pixel intensities along ridges and valleys in the different (too dark or too light) regions of the fingerprint. It involves pixel-wise operation or processing of one-by-one pixel. Different methods of normalizations are contrast stretching or histogram stretching. The purpose of changing the range is to eliminate any redundant pixels without compromising the quality of the fingerprint image. It enhances the clarity of the image under consideration.
            Contrast stretching is all about increasing the difference between the maximum intensity value in an image and the minimum one, while all the rest of the intensity
pixel values are spread out between this range of minimum and maximum values. There exists a one-to-one relationship of the intensity values between the source image and the target image, i.e., the original image can be restored from the contrast-stretched image.
            The contrast stretching method is used to normalize the gray level image received from the fingerprint sensor. The level of contrast in an image may vary due to poor illumination or improper setting in the acquisition sensor device. Therefore, there is a need to manipulate the contrast of an image in order to compensate for difficulties in image acquisition. The idea is to modify the dynamic range of the gray-levels in the image.
