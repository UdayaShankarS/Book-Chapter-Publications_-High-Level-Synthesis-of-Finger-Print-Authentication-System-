        Thinning - morphological operation used to eliminate or remove specific selected foreground pixels from binarized image. It is similar to the neighbourhood pixel processing and minimizes all the (thick) lines in to single pixel thickness.
        Here Hit-and-miss algorithm is used to thin and skeletonize the shape in a binarized image. This is an repeated process containing iterative steps to thin the shape by hit and-miss algorithm. In each iterative step, different structuring elements are used to identify the edge pixels to be deleted or removed.
