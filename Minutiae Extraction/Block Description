      The minutiae features are ridge ending (or terminations) and ridge bifurcations that are extracted from the fingerprint thinned image. Here the minutiae extraction is done by a morphological method of neighbourhood pixel processing.
      The Morphological approach based minutiae extraction method uses matching of the pixel template or kernel of various sizes to the pixels in (thinned) image in order to extract the minutiae. Morphology based method requires lower complexity.
