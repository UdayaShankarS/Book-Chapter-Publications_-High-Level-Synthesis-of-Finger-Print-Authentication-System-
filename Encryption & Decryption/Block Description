        The authentication stage involves the several additional processes like encryption and decryption. The features extracted from the fingerprint image using preprocessing is encrypted using encryption algorithms like advanced encryption standard (AES) or data encryption standard (DES) or Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) algorithms in order to protect the features and enhance the security, and then it is stored in the ROM to create the template. Here in this work AES is used to encrypt the features.
        Once the template is created after encryption and stored in the memory, the fingerprint system can be verified, as shown in figure 13.44. In the field, the data
acquired from the sensor is preprocessed to extract the features, while the features in the memory are in the encrypted format. Hence the encrypted features in the memory have to be decrypted using the same AES decryption algorithm to generate the exact features. The features obtained in field after preprocessing is compared with the decrypted features from the memory to detect both feature matches or not. Once both the features are matched, then the fingerprint of the corresponding user is correct otherwise it is an intruder fingerprint.
