          Smoothing reduces the noise within an image and improves quality of any images. It is basically performed by spatial or frequency filters. It reduces the intensity variation between two pixels.
          The median is measured by sorting all the pixels from the surrounding neighborhood pixel vlaues in numerical order and replacing the pixel values being considered with the middle pixel. If the neighborhood under consideration have even number of pixels, the average of two middle pixel values is used. The median filter is a kind of neighbourhood processing of pixel.
          The 3Ã—3 window is extracted from the 2D pixel image array to compute the median value of 9 pixels. The filter matches each pixel in the image to the surrounding neighbourhood pixel. The median filtering algorithm replaces the noise pixel by the median values of the surrounding neighbourhood pixels. This process continues and repeats until all the noise pixels in the fingerprint image are eliminated or removed.
          In case of a fingerprint image, the impulse noise are added during image acquisition from the sensor. Hence, smoothing median filter are used to reduce the amount of impulse noise in the acquired fingerprint image.
