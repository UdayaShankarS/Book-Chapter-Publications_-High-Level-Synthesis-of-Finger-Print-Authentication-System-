Smoothing is used to reduce the noise within an image and improves the quality of images. It is performed by spatial and frequency filters. It is also used in reducing the
amount of intensity variation between one pixel and the next.
The median is calculated by first sorting all the pixel values from the surrounding neighborhood into numerical order and then replacing the pixel being considered with the middle pixel value. If the neighborhood under consideration contains and
even number of pixels, the average of the two middle pixel values is used. The median filter works on neighbourhood processing of pixels.
The 3Ã—3 window is taken from the two-dimensional pixel array of image to compute the median value of 9 pixels. The filter compares each pixel in the image to the surrounding pixels. If one of the pixel values differs significantly from the
majority of the surrounding pixels, the pixel is treated as noise. The filtering algorithm then replaces the noise pixel by the median values of the surrounding pixels. This process repeats until all noise pixels in the image are removed.
For a fingerprint image, the impulse noise may be added during acquiring the image from the sensor. Hence smoothing median filter can be able to minimize the amount of impulse noise in the acquired fingerprint image.
